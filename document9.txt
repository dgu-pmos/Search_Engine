The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) came to Sweden's rescue as it was put to use in awarding the Swedes a penalty which led to the winning goal against South Korea on Monday.
Joel Aguilar had initially dismissed Swedish pleas for a second-half spot-kick, but for the second time
at the World Cup VAR came into play and after reviewing Kim Minwoo's tackle on Viktor Claesson the referee deemed it was a foul.
