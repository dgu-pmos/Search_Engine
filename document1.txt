The White House said Monday evening that if China goes through with its promise to retaliate against the US tariffs announced last week,
the United States will impose tariffs on an additional billion worth of Chinese goods.
"Further action must be taken to encourage China to change its unfair practices, open its market to United States goods,
and accept a more balanced trade relationship with the United States," Trump said in a statement.
The Trump administration said Friday that it will impose a tariff on billion of Chinese exports.
China, claiming the United States had "launched a trade war," retaliated almost immediately, outlining its own tariffs on US goods worth billion.
